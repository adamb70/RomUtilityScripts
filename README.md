## RomUtilityScripts
Collection of scripts to help build data for the RoM mod.

### How to use
Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install [gspread](https://github.com/burnash/gspread) and [oauth2client](https://github.com/google/oauth2client):

    pip install gspread oauth2client

You will also need the `Mistvalin-b3c187e87518.json` file to connect to the spreadsheet, which I can't publish so send me a message if you want it.
